			<strong>The following section describes AmerisourceBergen's
				privacy practices, including its policy for information received
				about you during visits to the Web Site: </strong>
		</p>

		<p>The amount and type of information received depends on how you
			use the Web Site. Your User ID and Password may be temporarily stored
			in a cookie allowing us to free resources for other customers if you
			are logged on but not actively using the portal. Data stored in the
			cookie will allow you to automatically log back on without
			re-entering your information during the same session.</p>

		<p>AmerisourceBergen will only use this information to identify
			and access your account to provide the requested services. Cookies
			and all data stored in the cookie will expire once you log off the
			AmerisourceBergen system.</p>

		<p>If you access or use the Web Site without using one of our
			online services, we do not collect or store information that will
			identify you. However, we may collect and store other information
			such as the name of your Internet Service Provider, the referral Web
			Site, requested pages including date and time of requests and other
			information to generate statistics and measure site activity to
			improve the usefulness of customer visits. In addition, we may
			request information such as your name, mailing address, e-mail
			address, phone number or social security number to provide you with a
			service or correspondence (such as promotional material) or to
			respond to questions or comments you send us. Such information
			(including your type of request and other information) is collected,
			stored and used in accordance with applicable laws and in a manner
			appropriate to the nature of your request and is used to fulfill it.
		</p>

		<p>Information you provide to AmerisourceBergen is also used to
			improve the services we provide to you.</p>

		<p>We may share personal information with our affiliates, other
			companies or agents in order for them to provide services for us;
			such information is shared and protected in accordance with
			applicable law. We do not otherwise share with or sell personal
			information to unrelated companies. As we continue to develop our
			business, we may buy or sell business divisions or companies, we may
			merge or combine with another company, or our company itself, or all
			or a significant part of its assets, may be acquired by another
			company. In such transactions, this information generally is one of
			the transferred and shared business assets. The information
			transferred and shared remains subject to the promises made in any
			pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, you have agreed to be
			subject to new privacy notice terms). We may decide to release your
			personal information if we believe release is appropriate or
			necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Web Site
			terms of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights,
			property, or safety of AmerisourceBergen.com, our users, or others.
			This information may be released or exchanged with other companies
			and organizations to protect against fraud or illegal activity, or
			for credit risk reduction. We will cooperate with law enforcement and
			judicial and regulatory authorities, and we may provide personally
			identifiable information to appropriate government authorities upon
			receipt of a subpoena or court order, or to cooperate with a law
			enforcement or regulatory investigation. We will fully cooperate with
			law enforcement and regulatory agencies in identifying those who use
			our services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to
			report to law enforcement and regulatory agencies activities that we
			in good faith believe to be illegal. We undertake no obligation or
			duty to release such information, however, unless we are required to
			do so under applicable laws.</p>

		<p>We provide email links on our "Contact Us" page that allow you
			to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have.
			We may receive a confirmation when you open any e-mail that we send
			to you, if your computer supports such capabilities. If you send us
			any email, we will retain such email and your email address for
			response. We also may compare our customer list to lists received
			from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary or
			duplicate messages to you.</p>

		<p>This Web Site is not directed or marketed at, nor intended for,
			children under 13 years of age. AmerisourceBergen does not knowingly
			collect any information, including personally identifiable
			information, from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that
			any information was provided to it through this Web Site by a person
			younger than 13 years of age, we will delete the information
			immediately.</p>

		<p>AmerisourceBergen may modify this privacy policy at any time
			and from time to time without prior notice. If AmerisourceBergen
			changes its privacy policy, the revised policy will apply only after
			the effective date of the revised policy. Your continued use of this
			Web Site following any new policy that is posted will be deemed your
			conclusive acceptance of the modified policy so you should
			periodically review this policy to be aware of such modifications.</p>
